title: The neural substrates of decision-making in alcohol addiction
description: On going fMRI task-based study 

---
The aim is to understand not just how previously Alcohol Dependent (AD) participant anticipate a reward, but how they react to rewarding outcomes compare to healthy participants. With 60 participants (30 in each group) we want to determine the main difference in addicted and healthy neural circuits of rewards. For this, we will use fMRI, during a Monetary Incentive Delay task and a Probabilistic CA-Learning task, to offer evidence of the temporally overlapping or distinct spatial representations of both cue and outcome valence and surprise. We used the CA task described above (Figure 1) with rating scales instead of pie chart. 
In addition to the CA task and the fMRI, the participant will fill multiples questionnaires that will be used as transdiagnostic biomarkers. The questionnaires will be similar to the ones that we selected for the study 1. 
Our aimed will be multiple, 1) we want to find the neural circuits implied in CA, 2) understand how it is disturbed in addiction, 3) find transdiagnostic biomarkers that could be used to offer a rapid and affordable diagnostic for addiction and 4) use our findings in a future ultrasound stimulation therapy.
