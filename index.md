I am a final year PhD student in Computational neuroscience in the [Fouragnan lab](https://www.elsa-fouragnan.com/) at the University of Plymouth.


I previously worked in [Visual Neuroscience lab](https://www.opto.umontreal.ca/neurosciences/)
in Montreal University (Canada) where I modeled the neural network of cortico-pulvino-cortical interactions.


I began my university training with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I have immediately focused my attention on <font color="#16868e">neuroscience</font>, and taken as many options that I could to learn as much as possible about the brain and its functions. I studied many <font color="#16868e">cognitive functions</font> there, with different approaches such as developmental, clinical and even social. I wanted to understand as much as I could about it, from a fundamental point of view, from the function, to the cellular and molecular mechanisms. Therefore during my last year of psychology I began another bachelor in Biology where I learnt more about <font color="#16868e"> genetic, biochemistry, molecular and cellular mechanisms</font>. 

After these very complementary studies, something important was missing that I felt was essential to understand some brain functions. In my opinion, to figure out a system such as the brain, it is crucial to model it, to study the relations and interactions between the parts of this system.That is why I specialized in system biology. During this master I specialised in <font color="#16868e"><strong> big data, computational neuroscience </strong></font> and <font color="#16868e"> modeling </font>.
